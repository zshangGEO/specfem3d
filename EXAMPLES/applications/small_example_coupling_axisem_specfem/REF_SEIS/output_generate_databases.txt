 NSPEC_global_min =          600
 NSPEC_global_max =          600
 NSPEC_global_max / NSPEC_global_min imbalance =    1.00000000      =    0.00000000      %
 NSPEC_global_sum =         2400

 NGLOB_global_min =        42025
 NGLOB_global_max =        42025
 NGLOB_global_max / NGLOB_global_min imbalance =    1.00000000      =    0.00000000      %
 NGLOB_global_sum =       168100

 If you have elements of a single type (all acoustic, all elastic, all poroelastic, and without CPML)
 in the whole mesh, then there should be no significant imbalance in the above numbers.
 Otherwise, it is normal to have imbalance in elements and points because the domain decomposer
 compensates for the different cost of different elements by partitioning them unevenly among processes.
